## How does brain injury affect people?

Everything depends on the severity of the injury. Even after a minor head injury, brain function can be temporarily impaired - this is sometimes called concussion. It can cause headaches, dizziness, fatigue, depression, irritability and memory problems. Most people who experience a minor head injury are symptom-free within two weeks. However, some can experience problems for months or years.

The more severe the brain injury, the more pronounced the long-term effects are likely to be. Survivors of more severe brain injury may have complex long-term problems that affect their [personality](https://www.headway.org.uk/about-brain-injury/individuals/effects-of-brain-injury/emotional-effects/), their [relationships](https://www.headway.org.uk/about-brain-injury/individuals/relationships-after-brain-injury/) and their ability to lead an independent life. When facing a challenging and uncertain future, it’s important to make good use of the [rehabilitation](https://www.headway.org.uk/about-brain-injury/individuals/rehabilitation-and-continuing-care/rehabilitation/) and [support](https://www.headway.org.uk/supporting-you/) available. No-one should go through this alone.
